# Gotta fetch() 'Em All / Pokemon battle
Welcome to the Gotta fetch() 'Em All project repository! Here, you will embark on an exciting journey into the world of Pok√©mon using the Pok√©Api. This project allows you to explore locations, encounter Pok√©mon, and engage in battles right from your browser.

## Installation
* Clone the repository: git clone <git@github.com:CodecoolGlobal/gotta-fetch-em-all-react-arvamartin.git>
* Install dependencies: npm install
* Start the development server: npm start
* Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

# Project Description
In this project, you will create a web application that interacts with the Pok√©Api to accomplish the following tasks:

### Show Locations and Encounter Pok√©mon
* Display the first 20 locations where Pok√©mon can be found.
* Clicking on a location fetches a random Pok√©mon encounter from that location.
* Display the encountered Pok√©mon's name and sprite on the page.

### Start a Pok√©mon Battle
* Choose one of your Pok√©mon to battle against the encountered Pok√©mon.
* Display both Pok√©mon's names and sprites.
* Implement turn-based attacks until one Pok√©mon's HP reaches 0.

### Capture or End Encounter
* If the encountered Pok√©mon's HP reaches 0, capture it and add it to your Pok√©mon collection.
* If your Pok√©mon's HP reaches 0 first, the encounter ends.
* After the encounter, display available locations again for further exploration.


## Technologies Used
* React: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
* JavaScript (ES6+): Language used for application logic.
* Fetch API: Used for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the Pok√©Api.
* CSS: Styling elements for a pleasant user experience.
